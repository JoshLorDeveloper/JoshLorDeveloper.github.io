I"&<p>The Intelligen Group Maker is a group creation desktop application that runs on an algorithm I designed to create groups from sets of probabilities. Users of the software can create groups with numerous preferences, providing advantages over commonly used random group creators. Additionally, settings exist that allow the user to create groups that decrease the chance that people will be in a group together twice. I made my group creation software using Java and JavaFX, and released it publicly on GitHub as a desktop application for Mac.</p>
