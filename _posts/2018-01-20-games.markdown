Developed three games available on the iOS app store. Each game taught me different development principles and skills. Creating Swirll I learned about geometric and trigonometric algorithms as all game elemnts are dynamically generated and all physics calculations are done without external libraries. Creating 200Â° I attempted to design a visually appealing and clean user interface, as prior I was not happy with my projects visuals. Creating BlockMaze I desgined and built the Maze generation algorithms and learned to integrate my own algorithms into my projects.
